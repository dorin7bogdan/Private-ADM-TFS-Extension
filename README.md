# Extension Functionality
##### UFT One File System Run
- When running tests, you can choose to upload the test result information generated by UFT One to an Azure Storage location. To support uploading UFT One test results to Azure Storage, perform the following steps:
  - Define the following pipeline variables:
    - **RESOURCE GROUP** - The name of the Resource Group
    - **STORAGE_ACCOUNT** - The name of the Storage Account you created for this purpose.
    - **CONTAINER** - The name of the Container
  - In the pipeline steps that runs your UFT One tests, specify that you want the UFT One results uploaded to storage and choose the artifacts to be uploaded
- Use this task to run tests located in your file system by specifying the tests' names, folders that contain tests, or an MTBX file (code sample below).
``` xml 
<Mtbx>
    <Test name="Test-Name-11" path="Test-Path-1">
    </Test>
    <Test name="Test-Name-2" path="Test-Path-2">
    </Test>
</Mtbx>
