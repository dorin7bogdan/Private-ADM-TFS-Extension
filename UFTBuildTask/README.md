# Integration with UFT One
This extension enables you to run UFT One tests as part of your Azure DevOps build process. In a build step, run UFT One tests stored in the local file system or on an ALM server. When running tests from ALM Lab Management, you can also include a build step that prepares the test environment before running. After the build is complete, you can view comprehensive test results.
